/*
Create a Book struct with the following fields:

title: String
author: String
year: u16
Implement the following functions:

save_books(books: &Vec<Book>, filename: &str): Saves all books to a file.
load_books(filename: &str) -> Vec<Book>: Loads books from a file.
In the main function:

Create a few Book instances
Save the books to a file
Load the books from the file and print them

Task:
Complete the save_books() function to write all books to a file. 
    Each book should be on a separate line with fields separated by commas.
Implement the load_books() function to read books from the file and return a Vec<Book>.
Run the program and verify that it correctly saves and loads the books.
